## Introduction
As an experienced Electrical-Electronics Engineer, I leverage strong SolidWorks capabilities to bridge the gap between abstract technical specifications and physical mechanical design. My focus is on creating high-fidelity 3D representations and assemblies that ensure seamless mechanical integration, functional accuracy, and manufacturability across **diverse engineering disciplines**.
This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio of my 3D CAD modeling work. It features a wide range of designs, from **precision electronic components** and **electromechanical machines** to **general mechanical assemblies**. Each model is engineered with a focus on strict adherence to datasheets, dimensional accuracy, and practical application in simulation or manufacturing.
